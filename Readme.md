Edit with multiple cursors and selections in Xcode 6.

##Installation
Install by moving the `.xcplugin` file from `Releases` into `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/`. Create any intermediate directories if necessary.

Alternatively, use Alcatraz once the plugin is added to it.

Addtionally, you can clone the project and build/run it. It will automatically launch a debugger session to the Xcode version specified in the scheme, and copy the plugin into the correct folder.
